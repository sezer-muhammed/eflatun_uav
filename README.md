Restructured Text (reST) and Sphinx CheatSheet
##############################################

.. topic:: Overview

    This page describes some of the RST and Sphinx syntax. It is based on resource found at `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_ , `Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ and more generally software documentation written with Sphinx. 


    This is not an exhaustive description but it should allow you to start and create already nice documentation.

Introduction
#############

The reStructuredText (RST) syntax provides an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax and parser system. However, you need to be very precise and stick to some strict rules: 

    * like Python, RST syntax is sensitive to indentation !
    * RST requires blank lines between paragraphs

This entire document is written with the RST syntax. In the right sidebar, you should find a link **show source**, which shows the RST source code.
